<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Before you install rss2email, you'll need to make sure that a few things are in place. First, is a version of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.x installed. Second, is whether you have sendmail (or a compatible replacement like postfix) installed. If sendmail isn't installed, determine your outgoing email server's address. That should be all you need.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<h3>Install</h3>

<p>Define your feeds</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$EDITOR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/r2e/feeds</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each feed on a line, if you want to customize the email adress to send to, put whitespace after the url and then the email address.
<br/>You can temporarily disable feeds by commenting them out (prefix with a '#').</p>

<p>When you run rss2email, it emails you about every story it hasn't seen before. But the first time you run it, that will be every story. To avoid this, you can ask rss2email not to send you any stories the first time you run it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>r2e run --no-send</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then later, you can ask it to email you new stories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>r2e run</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably want to set things up so that this command is run repeatedly. (One good way is via a cron job.)</p>

<p>If you get an error message "Sender domain must exist", add a line to <code>config.py</code> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>DEFAULT_FROM = rss2email@yoursite.com</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can make the email address whatever you want, but your mail server requires that the yoursite.com part actually exists.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to a new version</h3>
<p>Simply replace all of the files from the .tar.gz package to your install directory <strong style="color: red;">EXCEPT config.py</strong></p>



<h1 id="customizeit">Customize rss2email</h1>

<p>There are a number of options, described in full at the top of rss2email.py file, to customize the way rss2email behaves. If you want to change something, edit the <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/r2e/config.py</code> file. If you're not using rss2email under Windows, you'll have to create this file if it doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to receive HTML mail, instead of having entries converted to plain text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>HTML_MAIL = 1</code></p>

</blockquote>

<p>To be notified every time a post changes, instead of just when it's first posted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>TRUST_GUID = 0</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to make the emails look as if they were sent when the item was posted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>DATE_HEADER = 1</code></p>
