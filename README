== Goals ==

Respect for your $HOME, keeping it clean.
Good for your sanity, especially if you keep your $HOME
under version control

* adherence to XDG basedir spec
* plaintext, humanreadeble config file
* state in separate file, using pickle
* DEFAULT_TO goes in config.py

Added bonus:
things get simpler, you don't need r2e actions like
list/delete/add/reset: since everything is in regular files,
you can use your normal text editing tools
No need for special id's to refer to feeds, just the url.

And finally: avoid dangling locks.  Or locks alltogether.
Using the wrapper script, you avoid running the process twice.

All this applies to *nix users.  I guess these principles can be ported
to work on Windows as well, but I leave that to someone else.

Other improvements:
- better logging / debugging using python builtins over NIH cruft
- support for temporary disabling feeds (by commenting them out)

== Dependencies ==
 * python
 * feedparser (4.2 or svn version)
 * html2text (2.37 or higher)
