== Goals ==

Respect for your $HOME, keeping it clean.
Good for your sanity, especially if you keep your $HOME
under version control

* adherence to XDG basedir spec
* plaintext files, config and state being in separate files

Added bonus:
things get simpler, you don't need r2e actions like
list/delete/add/reset: since everything is in regular files,
you can use your normal text editing tools

This applies to *nix users.  I guess these principles can be ported
to work on Windows as well, but I leave that to someone else

And finally: avoid dangling locks.  Or locks alltogether.
Using the wrapper script, you avoid running the process twice.
